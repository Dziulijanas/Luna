                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The main goal of the game is to defeat the final boss and free Luna which can be freed only after beating the boss at the end of the level. The 2 players get to explore the mysterious land where Luna is held. Along their journey the players will encounter various different enemies with different health stats and a range of different attacks. They also will come across puzzles with various difficulties with different outcomes. The 2 players will need to work together to overcome obstacles in their journey!

                <h2>Level and Visual Design</h2>
                <p>We wanted the game to look very appealing to the players, we wanted to have a nice mysterious environment that is suitable for our target audience which is players 7+ years. We didn’t want to go for the standard forest environment as we felt it has been overused in many games before. We made sure that every asset that we have chosen is the same theme and fits in with our environment.
                    The players will begin the level on the left of the screen and continuously progress to the right, encountering various puzzles that need to be solved, without solving puzzles the players will be unable to progress the game further. The end of the level will have the main event, which is a boss fight and defeating him will result in game win screen or completion of the game.
